This document outlines the generated API specification in OpenAPI 3.0.0 format, derived from the five provided TypeScript concepts. The API uses a consistent JSON-RPC-like style, where all operations are `POST` requests, taking a single JSON object as input and returning a single JSON object. This aligns with the specified design principles for concept actions.
