## The Story of Yahir on a lazy rainy Saturday afternoon!
It’s a rainy day and Yahir has no school today! He is trying to listen to some tunes, so he goes onto his favorite music streaming platform, Spotify, and goes into his rainy day playlist but realizes he’s listened to these songs so many times already. He goes into his liked songs, and he sees wow 2,520 Liked Songs! Holy crap! It’s gotten a bit extensive and he can’t sift through his songs and realizes he doesn’t even remember the songs from the good old days since they’re just sitting at the bottom collecting dust! 

He can do as much exploring as he wants, but he knows there are hidden gems in his liked songs! He’s explored this problem and seen that many people are sharing this same sentiment of liked songs and he stumbles across a platform called Resurfacer! He connects his Spotify, looks through the platform, and decides on Swipe Sessions! He then plays around and chooses through a multitude of options (add to playlist, snooze, keep, skip) and gets to see his changes realized! He is satisfied with his session and ends it. He will come back to Resurfacer another day to explore the other options as he now has seen some interesting songs pop up from the random shuffle of his songs that focused on his old liked songs!
